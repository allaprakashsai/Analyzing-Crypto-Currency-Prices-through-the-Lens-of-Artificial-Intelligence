# Analyzing-Crypto-Currency-Prices-through-the-Lens-of-Artificial-Intelligence

Cryptocurrency is playing an increasingly important role in reshaping the financial system due 
to its growing popular appeal and merchant acceptance. While many people are making 
investments in Cryptocurrency, the dynamical features, uncertainty, the predictability of 
Cryptocurrency are still mostly unknown, which dramatically risk the investments. It is a matter 
to try to understand the factors that influence the value formation. In this study, we use 
advanced artificial intelligence frameworks of fully connected Artificial Neural Network 
(ANN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Recurrent Neural Network to analyze the price 
dynamics of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Ripple. We find that ANN tends to rely more on long-term 
history while LSTM tends to rely more on short-term dynamics, which indicate the efficiency 
of LSTM to utilize useful information hidden in historical memory is stronger than ANN. 
However, given enough historical information ANN can achieve a similar accuracy, compared 
with LSTM. This study provides a unique demonstration that Cryptocurrency market price is 
predictable. However, the explanation of the predictability could vary depending on the nature 
of the involved machine-learning model.
